## REPLICATION. HOW TO
1. Fork this repository.
2. Using RStudio open "2018-geofacet-mexico.Rproj" file in the main project directory.
3. Run the "R/master_script.R" file. 
Wait. That's it.
The results are stored in the sub-directory "figures".

## LOGIC OF THE PROCESS
The whole process is split into three parts, which is reflected in the structure of R scripts. First, the steps required for reproducibility are taken. Second, all data manipulation steps are performed. Finally, the figures are built. 
The names of the scripts are quite indicative, and each script is reasonably commented.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The initial version of the data visualization presented in this paper was originally developed by Ilya Kashnitsky in team work with [Michael Boissonneault][mb], [Jorge Cimentada][jc], [Juan Galeano][jg], [Corina Huisman][ch], and [Nikola Sander][ns] during the dataviz challenge at [Rostock Retreat Visualization][rr] event in June 2017. IK thanks his team members for the unique experience of super productive brainstorming and enthusiastic teamwork. The creative dataviz challenge was developed by [Tim Riffe][tr] and [Sebastian Kl√ºsener][sk], the organizers of [Rostock Retreat Visualization][rr].
